# Memristive deep belief network based on two-terminal floating gate memristor

This project deposits the MATLAB code for memristive deep belief nework based on two-terminal floating gate memristor (y-flash).
It contains:
#### Y-flash device behaivor modeling code
#### Online traning code for memristive deep belief network


## System requirements
### Hardware requirements
A standard computer that can install and run MATLAB.
### Software requirements
#### OS Requirements:
This package is supported for Windows, macOS and Linux.
Has been tested on MacOS (Apple Silicon).

#### Matlab requirements:
Matlab >= R2020a.

## Instructions to running the code

### Y-flash device behavior modeling
#### Cycle-to-cycle variation

#### Device-to-device variation

#### Memristive deep belief network for on-line training of MNIST


## Suggestion for further works based on this project
